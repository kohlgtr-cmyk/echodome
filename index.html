    <h2>Rock Band? (we also don't know)</h2>
    <p>Well, a little resume from us<br>
      We are a band that found some excluded musicians<br>
      some with a nice background story, others not so nice.<br>
      Just trying to release the songs out of the back of our minds<br>
      to the rest of the world.</p>

    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Our band was officially founded in July,2025
        but we are practicing a couple years now,
        we listen to various artists,
        noises in our heads, beating of the hearts, 
        even the little devil and angel in our shoulders.

                <h3>Vocalista Principal</h3>
                <p>⚙️ Origin:<br>
Before becoming <strong>DUSK</strong>, he was a road mechanic(or something like that, he never explain that part so good).<br>
He spent his days fixing cars and his nights playing bass in forgotten desert bars.<br>
During an electrical storm, a lightning struck the bar's generator while he was playing — the explosion left him unconscious for three weeks.<br>
When he woke up, he said he heard rhythms inside his own body.<br>
Since then, he plays with his face covered, saying that "the cold air keeps the sound inside."<br>
The bass is his breath — each note, a heartbeat.</p>

                <h3>Singer/Guitar</h3>
                <p>🌫️ Origin:<br>
<strong>TRACE</strong> was born from silence.<br>
Before the band existed, he was an independent singer who used to play in small clubs,<br>
always alone, always with his voice on the edge of breaking, someone who transformed noise and chaos into words.<br>
During a tour, a stage accident left him between life and nothingness.<br>
When he returned, his voice never sounded the same again — it gained texture, noise, pain.(it's what he said)<br>
He performed alone, with an old guitar and a hoarse voice — until one night he completely lost his voice during an underground show.<br>
No one knows how it happened — some say it was an accident, others speak of a live emotional breakdown.<br>
After that, he <i>disappeared.</i><br>
Months later, recordings of a metallic and distorted voice began to emerge,<br>
whispering lyrics about loss, guilt, and rebirth — all signed with the name <strong><i>“TRACE”</i></strong>.<br>
Today, <strong>TRACE</strong> sings with a bandage covering part of his face, saying it <i>“holds the sound in place”</i>,<br>
symbolizing the silence that marked him.<br>
No one knows his real name. He claims that <strong>“TRACE”</strong> is all that remains of him—the vestige of what he once was.<br>
His white guitar is called <i>“Echo”</i>, a symbol of rebirth and remembrance.<br>
On stage, he sings as if trying to remember who he was before the sound consumed him.<br>
His white guitar represents the contrast between purity and noise—he says it’s <i>“the color that sound would have, if sound could shine”</i>.</p>

              <p>🌫️ Origin:<br>
No one knows for sure who he was before becoming <strong>OD</strong>.<br>
They say he was an underground guitarist from a forgotten scene, known for playing with so much volume and distortion that the amplifiers literally burned.<br>
During a performance, a fire engulfed the stage—and he disappeared amidst the smoke and sound.<br>
Months later, mysterious videos began circulating of a masked figure with neon green hair playing impossible riffs in abandoned warehouses.<br>
The sound seemed to come from another plane, a mixture of pain, anger, and pure electrical energy.<br>
<strong>OD</strong> plays as if sound were a weapon.<br>
He never speaks in interviews, never shows his face—he only appears amidst the smoke and lights.<br>
The "mummy" bandage covering his mouth and nose is a reminder of the fire, but also a symbol: <i>he is the "guitarist who silenced the real world."</i><br>
His name comes from the guitar pedal he destroyed while creating the riff that would define the band's sound — <strong>Overdrive</strong>.</p>

No one knows <strong>EMBER's</strong> real name.<br>
They say he started playing in abandoned factories, using pieces of metal, cans, and chains to create his own rhythm.<br>
People called him the sound that never sleeps.<br>
During a fire in a warehouse where he used to rehearse, the sound was reported missing, as the warehouse fell completely silent after that day.<br>
Days later, a drummer appeared with his face covered and a burning gaze, and everyone thought, <i>"Could it be him?"</i><br>
Since then, fire has become part of his essence—he plays as if each beat were the last spark of a world about to explode.</p>

                <p>🌙 Origin:
Before she was known as <strong>Lyra</strong>, she was just a shadow in the background — a composer who wrote soundtracks for dreams that were never remembered.<br>
It is said that she used to play alone in empty stations, using the sound of the passing train as a metronome.
No one has heard from her since the day her voice broke at an experimental show.
Since then, she communicates only with the keyboard — transforming emotions into frequencies, and silence into melody.
When <strong>TRACE</strong> invited her to join the band, he simply said:<br>
<i>“We don’t need your voice. <storng>We</storng> need you.”</i><br>
Now, <strong>LYRA</strong> is the calm heart of chaos, the sound between the beats of <strong>EMBER</strong>,
the echoes of <strong>DUSK</strong> and the screams of <strong>TRACE</strong>.

                <h3>The Beginning of EchoDome</h3>
                <p>
                    It all started in an abandoned studio on a rainy night in 2023...
                    <br><br>
                    TRACE was playing alone when OD walked in, guitar in hand. 
                    They jammed for hours without saying a word.
                    <br><br>
                    EMBER found them through the noise - literally. She was living in the apartment above 
                    and came down to complain, but ended up joining instead.
                    <br><br>
                    LYRA appeared one day, set up her keyboard in the corner, and never left.
                    <br><br>
                    DUSK was the last piece. He heard them from the street and knew he had found his home.
                    <br><br>
                    We didn't choose each other. The music did.
