        lyrics: `[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
You’re standing there
On a balcony in summer air

I see the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
You see me make my way through the crowd
And say: Hello
Little did you know

[Pre-chorus]
That I was Romeo and I were throwing pebbles
And your daddy said: Stay away from Juliet
And you were crying on the staircase
Begging me: Please, don't go

[Chorus]
And you said: Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, uh, oh

[Pre-chorus]
'Cause I was Romeo, you were a scarlet letter
And your daddy said: Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
You were begging me: Please, don't go

[Chorus]
And I said: Juliet, I take you somewhere we can be alone
Just keep waiting, all there's left to do is run
I'll be the prince and you'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes

[Verse 3]
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

You said: Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
I knelt to the ground, pulled out a ring

[Outro]
And said: Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say yes

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you`,

        lyrics: `[Verse]
    The photographs are fading on my wall,
    Names I can't recall in the shadows fall.
    Classrooms hum with voices I once knew,
    Laughter in the air that never rang true.

    [Pre-Chorus]
    Time rewinds like whispers down the hall,
    Footsteps echo but they never call.
    Was I ever really part of the scene?    
    Or just a ghost in someone else's dream?

    [Chorus]
    Oh, the echoes of yesterday are slipping through my hands,
    Like castles built on shifting sands.
    We were chapters in a book never read,
    Now the ink has bled, the words are dead.

    [Verse]
    Desk carvings fade with every passing spring,
    Promises we made don't mean a thing.
    Reunions pass like strangers in the night,
    No wrongs to right, no flames to light.

    [Pre-Chorus]
    Yearbooks gather dust upon the shelf,
    Memories I keep but can't reclaim myself.
    Did we ever really share the same sky?
    Or was I just learning how to say goodbye?

    [Chorus]
    Oh, the echoes of yesterday are slipping through my hands,
    Like castles built on shifting sands.
    We were chapters in a book never read,
    Now the ink has bled, the words are dead.
    
    [Chorus]
    Oh, the echoes of yesterday are slipping through my hands,
    Like castles built on shifting sands.
    We were chapters in a book never read,
    Now the ink has bled, the words are dead.

    [Chorus]
    Oh, the echoes of yesterday are slipping through my hands,
    Like castles built on shifting sands.
    We were chapters in a book never read,
    Now the ink has bled, the words are dead.`,

        lyrics:`[Verse 1]
Eu não queria sentir assim
Era só mais um rosto na multidão
Mas quando você olhou pra mim
Alguma coisa saiu do controle da minha razão
Eu tentei fingir que era normal
Que era só coisa da minha cabeça
Mas toda vez que você passava
Meu mundo inteiro desaparecia

[Pré-Refrão]
Eu tento me esconder
Mas meus olhos me traem
Tudo que eu calei
Começa a gritar
[Refrão – explosivo]
Seu olhar me atravessa
Me desmonta por dentro
Eu perco o ar
Eu perco o centro
Eu tentei resistir
Mas não dá pra negar
Quando você me olha assim
Eu deixo tudo desabar

[Verso 2]
Eu me construí pra não sentir
Levantei muros pra me proteger
Mas você passa por cada um deles
Sem nem perceber
E eu odeio admitir
Que preciso de você aqui
Porque quando você não está
Parece que eu deixo de existir

[Pré-Refrão]
Eu finjo não ligar
Mas meu silêncio entrega
Cada batida do meu peito
Chamando por você

[Refrão]
Seu olhar me atravessa
Rasga tudo que eu sou
Me tira do escuro
Que eu mesmo criei ao redor
Eu tentei resistir
Mas não dá pra fugir
Quando você me olha assim
Eu começo a ruir

[Ponte]
Eu lutei contra isso
Eu neguei, eu fingi
Mas quanto mais eu me escondo
Mais eu corro pra ti
Se amar é perder o controle
Então eu já perdi
Se isso é fraqueza
Então eu escolhi

[Último Refrão]
Seu olhar me atravessa
E eu não quero escapar
Se for pra me quebrar por dentro
Que seja pra me transformar
Quando você me olha assim
Não existe mais chão
Só o som do meu peito
Explodindo em suas mãos`,

        lyrics:`[Verse 1]
I feel stuck
Face down on the floor
I want to change
But I don’t know what for
I try to follow my dream
But I never wrote it down
Time moves faster than me
And I’m still spinning around
Then I ask myself, “What now?”
But the silence is too loud

[Pre-Chorus]
Every second that I waste
Feels like I’m fading away
I’m tired of living the same
On repeat every day

[Chorus]
Happiness is not a goal
It’s the journey that you take
If I don’t start moving now
My whole life will be fake
I don’t want to be
Another victim of doubt
Just another lost soul
In the lost dreams town

[Verse 2]
I built walls out of fear
Called it “playing safe”
Watched my years disappear
While I learned how to wait
I kept saying “someday”
Like it’s coming for free
But someday never shows
If it’s up to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Every chance that I ignore
Turns into regret
I’m done with standing still
I’m not finished yet

[Chorus]
Happiness is not a goal
It’s the fire in your veins
If I don’t chase it now
I’ve got no one else to blame
I don’t want to be
Another name worn down
Just another broken voice
In the lost dreams town

[Bridge]
What if I fail?
What if I fall?
What if I’m not enough at all?
But what if I fly?
What if I try?
What if this fear is just a lie?

[Final Chorus]
Happiness is not a goal
It’s every step you make
And I’d rather fall chasing truth
Than live a life that’s fake
I won’t be
Another victim of doubt
I’m breaking out right now
From this lost dreams town`,

        lyrics: `[Verse 1]
It’s 2 a.m. again.
I’m awake.
Not because I want to be.
Just… thinking.
About everything I have to hold together.
About how I don’t remember
the last time I felt light.
I don’t say that out loud.
I just carry it.

[Verse 2]
I’ve learned how to function tired.
How to smile on low battery.
How to answer “I’m good”
without meaning it.
It’s not a lie.
It’s just easier.

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I wonder
if anyone would notice
how close I am
to empty.
Not broken.
Just… worn.

[Chorus]
I’m still moving.
Still doing what I’m supposed to do.
But somewhere between responsibility
and expectation
I misplaced something that felt like me.
I’m not asking to escape.
I’m not asking for less.
I just wish
being strong
didn’t feel like disappearing.

[Verse 3]
There’s a younger version of me
that still knocks sometimes.
He asks if we’re happy.
If we’re trying.
If we remember what we wanted.
I tell him
“Not now.”
And I hate that answer.

[Bridge]
I don’t want to quit.
I don’t want to run.
I just don’t want to wake up
one day
and realize
I survived everything
but never lived.

[Outro]
I’m still here.
Still holding it all together.
I just hope
there’s still something of me
between the lines.`,
